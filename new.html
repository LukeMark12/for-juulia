          <span>Juulia,</span>
          <br />
          I want to share something with you, today is national girlfriend day, and it got me thinking about how much I enjoy my times with you during these hangout.</br>
        </br>
          I really like you, and I would love the opportunity to be more than just friends.
          Would you like to be my girlfriend on this national girlfriend day ? No pressure, but I want to be honest about my feeling I want to tell these thing outside when we met but you were not here so I just decided text .
          Take your time to think about it and no matter what, I appreciate your friendship a lot.
